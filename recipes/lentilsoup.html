    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a dish I found a few years ago. I was looking for a healthy, cheap, and easy dish to feed my family. And this dish is perfect for that.</p>
        <p>These ingredients are easily found in every pantry so this is a perfect dish for all family </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
       <ul>
           <li>3 tablespoons extra–virgin olive oil</li>
           <li>2 cups chopped onions</li>
           <li>1 cup chopped celery stalk</li>
           <li>1 cup chopped carrots</li>
           <li>2 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
           <li>4 cups (or more) vegetable broth</li>
           <li>1 1/4 cups lentils, rinsed, drained</li>
           <li>1 14 1/2–ounce can diced tomatoes in juice</li>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium–high heat. Add onions, celery, carrots, and garlic; sauté until vegetables begin to brown, about 15 minutes. Add 4 cups broth, lentils, and tomatoes with juice and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium–low, cover, and simmer until lentils are tender, about 35 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer 2 cups soup (mostly solids) to blender and puree until smooth. Return puree to soup in pan; thin soup with more broth by 1/4 cupfuls, if too thick. Season with salt, pepper, and a splash of vinegar, if desired. Ladle soup into bowls. Garnish with celery leaves.</li>
